5</span>ULF VAN YERN</h2>
<p>It was youthful Ulf Van Yern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Goes before the King to stand:<br />
&ldquo;To avenge my father&rsquo;s death<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lend me warriors of thy band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my kemps I&rsquo;ll lend thee them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who to follow thee consent;<br />
Ask&rsquo;st thou Vidrik Verlandson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt further thy intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lend thee of my men,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt have the very flower;<br />
Vidrik, and stark Diderik,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Many kemps have felt their power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are heroes strong and bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who have battles often won;<br />
Feared are they in every land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where their names&rsquo; renown has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>In walked he, the good Dane King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glittering like the morning star:<br />
&ldquo;Which of ye, my Danish swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will attend my friend to war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stalked the King along the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bore a gold cup in his hand:<br />
&ldquo;Which of ye, my courtmen, will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow Wolf with shield and brand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To their mouths their hats they held,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None to answer him made haste,<br />
Save bold Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of them all he made a jest.</p>
<p>It was Vidrik Verlandson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of his comrades made a sport:<br />
&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;tis but to guzzle mead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are gathered here at court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrathful Diderik straight became,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Frantic at that word he grew;<br />
Off he smote two warriors&rsquo; heads,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the King&rsquo;s foot them he threw.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Then spake Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His whole thought on honor lies:<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll dispatch our messenger<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not go in stealthy guise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was youthful Hammergray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurried from the city gate;<br />
Every one on him that looked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost his voice and colour straight.</p>
<p>Hark away, young Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold is glittering on thy breast;<br />
Ne&rsquo;er was found or hawk or hound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could with Hammer&rsquo;s speed contest.</p>
<p>Pearls upon his bosom shone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks thereat astounded gaze:<br />
Fowl was none beneath the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could with youthful Hammer race.</p>
<p>Swift into the King&rsquo;s high hill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bounded youthful Hammergray:<br />
He was nimble at the tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And could speak in gallant way.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;King of Brattens Vendel, hail!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rest that fill your hall;<br />
Ulf Van Yern to-morrow comes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To avenge his father&rsquo;s fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better had he be at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tending sheep beneath the height,<br />
Better than a message send<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he thither comes to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better had he crawl at home<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a worm the rock beneath,<br />
Than the war-like struggle dare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where his father sank in death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He at home had better stay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crouch and shake the bush below;<br />
One blow only stood his sire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll not stand me half a blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King of Brattens Vendel, hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep your tongue behind your tooth;<br />
Quickly grows the young whelp up,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of threatening fangs his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;In the world no warrior wight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lives for whom I need to care,<br />
Save &rsquo;tis Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I trow he&rsquo;ll not be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answered then the Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Answered to the Monarch&rsquo;s fright:<br />
&ldquo;It is Vidrik Verlandson<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will our army lead in fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose a Brattens Vendel kemp,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he shouted lustily:<br />
&ldquo;Well, full well, I Vidrik know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Offspring of a blacksmith he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once was I at Birtingsborg<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the kempions drank their fill,<br />
There he played a play which lives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In my mind, and ever will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen kemps to death he smote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he deemed it but as game;<br />
Nigh at hand I gazing stood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashy pale my cheeks became.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Listen now, young Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strongly I entreat of thee,<br />
If of Vidrik aught thou know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to keep it hid from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sick in bed if Vidrik lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor could sword nor buckler yield,<br />
Many a Danish swain you&rsquo;d find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would await you in the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loudly answered then the King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through his veins rushed courage warm:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll to-morrow, if I live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet ye in the battle&rsquo;s storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From beside the King&rsquo;s right hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose a kemp, a stalwart one:<br />
&ldquo;What care we for such like foes?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vidrik&rsquo;s but a blacksmith&rsquo;s
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the young Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At that word his wrath boiled o&rsquo;er;<br />
Straight he smote the kempion dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead he tumbled on the floor.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Said the Monarch with a cry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While with rage his cheek grew white:<br />
&ldquo;Why hast thou my bravest kemp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smit to death before my sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereto answered Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the King he fiercely eyed:<br />
&ldquo;I could ne&rsquo;er with patience hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Verland&rsquo;s valiant son decried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight away rushed Hammergray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon he stood by Vidrik knight:<br />
&ldquo;Whet your spears, and sharp your swords,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the King is bent on fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the mirky night they rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the dusky heathery down,<br />
Still a light like that of day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From their polished weapons shone.</p>
<p>Over Birting&rsquo;s moor they rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through Birting&rsquo;s swamp in haste;<br />
Full seven hundred were the kemps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All in hard cuirasses cas&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Towards Birting on they rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Birting&rsquo;s city they rode through;<br />
Then they formed them in a ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made Vidrik chief anew.</p>
<p>On the down their flag they pitched,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein you a lion may spy;<br />
Now must many an innocent man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid to life a long good-bye!</p>
<p>Long they fought with sword and bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each essayed his best to do;<br />
From their brows burst ruddy sweat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From their bucklers fire out flew.</p>
<p>It was then the Vendel King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his helm a glance he cast:<br />
&ldquo;Say, who leads that band to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That my people fall so fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight replied the little page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the King rode next of all:<br />
&ldquo;Sir, &rsquo;tis Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sits upon his courser tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Answered one of the King&rsquo;s kemps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had been in many fields:<br />
&ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mimmering <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> in his hand he
wields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereto made the King reply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As another glance he throws:<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Gainst the shield I ill shall fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the tongs and hammer shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Gainst the shield I ill shall fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the tongs and hammer bears,<br />
This day I am doomed to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For fierce Vidrik no one spares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathen wight, and Christian knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fight with glad and fain;<br />
Only not with Verland&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For from him I scathe must gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ha! Hurrah! the Vendel King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In his steed the rowels drove;<br />
Desperate he at Vidrik went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Desperate he to fell him strove.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Bravely done, thou Vendel King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast and hard thy strokes are plied<br />
E&rsquo;en to his good saddle bow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vidrik stoops his helm of pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve from thee borne eighteen blows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They are, Sir, nor more nor fewer,<br />
For thy kingly honor now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But one blow from me endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou eighteen blows hast borne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be they fewer or be they more,<br />
I&rsquo;ll the self-same number take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gift of love can break their power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forth a silken thread he drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tied it round his helm of gold:<br />
&ldquo;My heart&rsquo;s dear shall never hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow of blacksmith laid me cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vidrik spake to Mimmering:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Show thou&rsquo;rt yet for something good;<br
/>
I can say for fifteen years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I more fiercely have not hew&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Grasped he then the hilt so hard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his nails that blood outstarted,<br />
On the Monarch&rsquo;s helm he hew&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the navel him he parted.</p>
<p>Shouted Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the verdant height:<br />
&ldquo;Be there one of all your host<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has further wish to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the Brattens Vendel King<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies out pouring blood like water:<br />
Vengeance now has Ulf Van Yern,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vengeance for his father&rsquo;s slaughter.</p>
<p>It was youthful Hammergray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glanced around the bloody field:<br />
&ldquo;So like mice in their first sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hushed the foemen lie, and still&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladly back with Ulf Van Yern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rode the Dane King&rsquo;s chivalry;<br />
For his sire avenged he thanked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vidrik oft and fervently.</p>

16</span>THE CHOSEN KNIGHT</h2>
<p>Sir Oluf rode forth over hill and lea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full seven mile broad and seven mile wide,<br />
But no one living discovered he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who a joust with him dare ride.</p>
<p>He saw, whilst forward glancing,<br />
A gallant knight advancing,<br />
Black was his courser, his helm was lac&rsquo;d,<br />
He came with bounding haste.</p>
<p>Upon his spurs all gory<br />
Twelve gilded birdies bore he;<br />
Each time with the rowel he pricked his horse<br />
The birdies sang with all their force.</p>
<p>Twelve gilt wheels on his bridle<br />
He bore, nor were they idle;<br />
Each time through them the breezes blew,<br />
How quickly around the little wheels flew.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>He carried before his breast<br />
A long lance, placed in rest;<br />
Far sharper than diamond was that lance,<br />
It laid Sir Oluf in deadly trance.</p>
<p>Aloft on his helm he show&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A chaplet of red glare;<br />
Three maidens in proof of their love bestow&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The youngest was so fair.</p>
<p>Sir Oluf enquired of the knight,<br />
An he were come down from the realms of light:<br />
&ldquo;Art thou the Christ, for if thou be,<br />
I&rsquo;ll willingly bend before thee the knee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the Christ of power,<br />
Thou need&rsquo;st not before me cower;<br />
An unknown knight thou see&rsquo;st in me,<br />
Sent forth by three maids of high degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou be a chosen knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom maidens three have sent this way,<br />
Then for love of those damsels bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt joust with me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>The first course they together rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of their coursers trial made they,<br />
The second course they together rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their best manhood well display&rsquo;d they.</p>
<p>The third joust they together rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither one the other humbled,<br />
But the fourth joust they together rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead to the green earth they tumbled.</p>
<p>Now on the wold the heroes lie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their blood the grass is red;<br />
In the chamber high sit the maids and sigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the youngest soon is dead.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>SIR SWERKEL</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dance in the hall of Sir Swerkel the
Childe,<br />
There dances fair Kirstine, her hair hanging wild.</p>
<p>There dance the good King and his nobles so gay,<br />
Fair Kirstine before them she warbles a lay.</p>
<p>His hand to the maiden Sir Swerkel stretched free:<br />
&ldquo;Come hither and dance, little Kirstine, with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her finger he pressed, and moved up to her near:<br />
&ldquo;Sweet Kirstine, I pray thee become my heart&rsquo;s
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Her finger he pressed, on her sandal trod he:<br />
&ldquo;Fair Kirstine, with pity my agonies see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They danced to the left, and they danced to the right,<br />
And her troth the fair damsel bestowed on the knight.</p>
<p>Upon him Sir Swerkel his red mantle throws,<br />
And to the high hall to his mother he goes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, hail as thou sittest here, dear mother mine!<br
/>
I come from betrothing the little Kirstine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Lady forbid, and our Lady forfend,<br />
Relations like ye to betroth should pretend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In wedlock united ye never must be,<br />
For brother and sister, believe me, are ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, I pray thee, O dear mother mine!<br />
What time thou didst bring forth the little Kirstine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;The time that thou wast on thy journey to
Rome,<br />
I bore the sweet flowret that&rsquo;s now in full bloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst thou to the sepulchre holy wast gone,<br />
I bore the fair mirror thy love that hast won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the court of the Queen she was reared up with
care,<br />
And scarlet and sable accustomed to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give me thy counsel, O dear mother mine,<br />
How I may forget her, the little Kirstine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the hind,<br
/>
And thou wilt her image soon chase from thy mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the roe,<br
/>
And thou thy love-longing wilt quickly forego.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>He chased the proud hart, and he chased the swift
hind,<br />
But he never could chase the fair maid from his mind.</p>
<p>He chased the tall hart, and he chased the sleek roe,<br />
But the longing of love from his mind would not go.</p>
<p>So the knight from the country was driven at last,<br />
And into a cloister the maiden was cast.</p>
<p>No little bird shaped from the far land its flight<br />
Than enquiry she made for her dear betrothed knight.</p>
<p>A bird ne&rsquo;er so little across the sea stray&rsquo;d<br
/>
But he enquired after his dear betrothed maid.</p>

THE TRIAL OF WITS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s rifer than leaves?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br

&ldquo;Dew is more rife,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hotter than fire?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;The face of a kind-hearted man,&rdquo; she replied,</p>

&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s sense at a pinch,&rdquo; the damsel

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s best of all gems?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;A knife or a dirk,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ship for all cargoes?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;The tongs of the smith,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiter than snow?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;Truth is more white,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many trees are there?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;The green and the sere make two,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s reddest of red?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;The flush of the freeman when praised,&rdquo; she
replied.<br />
&ldquo;Or when praise to his merit is meanly denied.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;The friendship of man,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>

&ldquo;High deeds, humble words,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of all fare?&rdquo; Finn cried.<br />
&ldquo;Strong drink, if it be too freely supplied,<br />
Or the prate of a fool,&rdquo; the damsel replied.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
